## Problem Statement
Our chosen problem statement is Detecting Hate speech in social media, and the aim of our project is to recognize and detect hate speech in text through sentiment analysis of the text in question.

As such, we intend to build a hate speech classifier, with the tentative end goal of making a telegram chatbot that can self moderate a telegram chat by identifying and removing hateful messages

## Motivation
Nowadays, hate speech such as racist, sexist, derogatory comments and more are often made by one another, not only in offline environment but also immensely in online environments like social networking websites and online communities. With the democratization of social media, many hate groups have moved to social media platforms, allowing individuals to interact with hate and maintain connections with likeminded people, and take part in real-world actions, such as the siege on the U.S. Capitol carried out by Trumpâ€™s supporters.

Hate speech incite conflicts, spread terrible misdirected ideologies and creating a negative influence overall, which can have spillover effect into real life in the form of physical violence. To thwart such incidents from happening, a Detection combined with Prevention System in all social networking websites and applications, including all the communities, existing in the digital world is a necessity.
